2. **Search Interface Prompt**
Tool: Github Copilot
Model: GPT-4.1
Prompt:
```markdown
Implement an async fetch function to load talents from an API that returns a newline-delimited JSON stream (profileStream format). Add a loading indicator while fetching. Replace mockTalents with fetched data. The API call handles the filtering. Lets update the component to function this way: On load, we call an endpoint that returns a default stream, we can filter by this stream on the client. When the results on the stream is less than a certain value, we call the endpoint with the new search value.
```

3. **Opprortunities Page Prompt**
Tool: Bolt.new
Model: Bolt.new Default Model
Prompt:
```markdown
Create a professional opportunity details page that effectively showcases the following elements:

Header Section:

Display a prominent job title in [font size 24px, bold]
Place the company logo [dimensions: 120x120px] to the right of the title
Include a compelling tagline [max 15 words] that captures the role's impact
Add a concise job description [2-3 sentences] highlighting key responsibilities
Compensation Package:

List salary range with currency [e.g., $XX,XXX - $XX,XXX]
Present benefits in a clean, scannable format using bullet points
Highlight unique perks or special offerings
Include remote/hybrid work arrangements if applicable
Skills & Requirements:

Create a structured skills matrix with 3 columns:
Skill Category
Specific Skills
Required Proficiency Level [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
Distinguish between required and preferred skills
Include years of experience requirements if applicable
Visual Elements:

Add relevant platform logos [size: 32x32px] in the footer
Ensure all logos maintain consistent spacing [20px apart]
Use company brand colors for accents and highlights
Maintain responsive design for mobile viewing
The design should prioritize readability and user engagement while maintaining professional aesthetics.
```
4.**Astro Dynamic Routing Error**
Tool: Github Copilot
Model: GPT-4.1
Prompt:
```markdown
/fix Type '{ "client:load": true; slug: string; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.
Property 'slug' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.
```

5. **Profile Page Fetch**
Tool: Github Copilot
Model: GPT-4.1
Prompt:
```markdown
Implement a fetch function in the ProfilePage component that initializes the page using the dynamic slug value passed as a prop. Use this slug to retrieve data from an API endpoint whose response format is defined in profile.json. Once the data is fetched, update the component to render all relevant information based on the response structure.
Additionally, identify and suggest any missing or necessary HTML elements (e.g. headings, images, social links, sections) that should be included in the component to properly display all important data fields returned in profile.json. Ensure the layout remains clean, accessible, and responsive.
```
6. ** Opportunities Matching**
Tool: Github Copilot
Model: GPT-4.1
```markdown
* Replace the hardcoded job card fields with dynamic values from the job object, matching the keys from opportunity.json.
* Map all relevant fields: title/objective, company, logo, tagline, type, compensation, skills, requirements, match %, posted date, remote, etc.
* Add missing HTML elements for:
  * Members (showing at least the main poster's name and headline)
  * Opportunity type (employee/contractor)
  * Compensation periodicity and negotiable status
  * Deadline (application deadline)
  * Service types (if relevant)
  * Video URL (if present)
* Use fallback values or placeholders where data may be missing.

Explain how to fix this build error:
12:53:44 [ERROR] [vite] x Build failed in 316ms
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "sharp" from "D:/Code/torre-technical-test/node_modules/astro/dist/assets/services/sharp.js".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
